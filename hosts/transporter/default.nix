  # Dell Latitude 7280 — TESTBED host for the ClaudeOS return.
  # Purpose: prove the integration story (Claude desktop app, Chrome extension
  # native messaging, VSCode, file pickers/drag-and-drop, MCP experimentation)
  # on real hardware before gti is reinstalled.
  #
  # First-install checklist (see docs/SECRETS.md for details):
  #   1. After install, derive this host's age key:
  #        nix shell nixpkgs#ssh-to-age -c ssh-to-age < /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub
  #   2. Add it to .sops.yaml as &transporter_host and run
  #        sops updatekeys secrets/secrets.yaml
  #      Until then, sops secrets won't decrypt here (jasper will stay down).

  # TESTBED TRIAL (tool-rethink 2026-06-12): iwd as NetworkManager's wifi
  # backend — faster scans, better roaming, WPA3, while NM keeps the GNOME
  # integration. Graduates to modules/common/networking.nix if the trial
  # holds. Note: wifi passphrases are entered fresh (no wpa_supplicant
  # profile migration — fresh install anyway).
